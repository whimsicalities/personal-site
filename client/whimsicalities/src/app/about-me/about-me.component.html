    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm whimsicalities, and this is my site. I'm a software engineer working in the games industry. In my free time I make as much art as I can manage, but you won't find it here. I have a particular interest in the 2010s-era virtual pet websites, which you will certainly find here.</p>
